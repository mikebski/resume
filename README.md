Selected Projects
-----------------
 
**HRSync**

Designed and developed an ETL software package primarily used to move data between HR/Identity Management systems and access control system.  The software was used by enterprise customers to reduce data entry errors, simplify internal workflows and ensure industry specific audit requirements were met.
 
**CARMA for Picture Perfect**

Designed, developed and supported a data warehouse and web-based reporting program for the GE Picture Perfect access control system.  The database was designed to process tens of millions of transactions via a web based UI.  This tool gave users an easy-to-use, non-technical interface allowing them to run reports on-demand while not affecting the production system.  This not only reduced the load on the server, it moved the report generating responsibility from the system administrators and allowed stakeholders to run their own reports.  The UI was written in PHP, the data import was written in C++ and the database platform was MySQL.

**State of Florida DHSMV FUPAC Project**

The DHSMV in FL had a disparate access control system at each of its 12 deep water seaports.  We were responsible for visiting each port, exporting all cardholder and image information from each system, and turning them over to GE for conversion to their new system.  Once the new system was installed, we were responsible for patching the software and installing the peripheral devices for biometric enrollment of cardholders (passport scanners, fingerprint enrollment devices, and cameras).  We also trained staff according to the enrollment process developed by the DHSMV.

Selected Projects
-----------------

**2015 - Present: Selenium/Jenkins integration environment**

Configured and maintained a Jenkins CI server that ran daily Selenium regression tests via a proprietary framework.  Configured 8 different applications to run regression tests against DEV, MAINT, and 2 STG environments.  Enhanced and maintained an application to generate a dashboard for Selenium test results.

**2014-2015: Engineering Request Forms**

Implemented an internal web-based tool to facilitate communication between sales and engineering staff.  Engineering required a workflow that would allow requests to be submitted, approved, designed and accepted.  The workflow needed to be simple, web-based, and allow reporting on performance indicators.  The application was written using Spring MVC and Spring Data running in a Tomcat container with a SQL Server repository.

**2012-2015: Invarios**

Participated in development and implementation of a customized ETL tool for enterprise Access Control systems.  The Java tool was based on Pentaho's PDI application with custom steps that we developed.  Plugins included a PDI step to transform images to a size and format appropriate for storage in Active Directory and a database update step that logged every change to a database record during an update for auditing reports.  This software was implemented at several enterprise client sites and is a part of the company product portfolio.

**2013-2015: Company Timesheets**

Designed and implemented a web-based timesheet system for the company.  Implemented a timesheet system to allow all remote employees to enter timesheet data into our SharePoint site.  This included a custom workflow to require management approval of time entries.  Once time was approved by management, the data was then imported into a data warehouse and was available for import into the company ERP system.  The SharePoint UI piece was written with JQuery/JQuery UI for the front-end and used SharePoint lists via the Javascript API for the data storage.  The imported data was stored in a SQL server and the front-end was a Spring Web MVC application in a Tomcat container using OrmLite for data access.

**June 2015: Service Ticket Portal**

Designed and implemented a cloud service ticket portal for a large national customer.  Allows customer to enter service tickets online, and notify proper parties that a ticket has been created.  The customer was using PDF forms to submit tickets, but could no longer support the PDF form and needed an alternative.  This project was completed early and under the estimated budget.  The technology used was Django and Postgre SQL served with Lighttpd and Gunicorn on an Ubuntu Linode instance.  Setup a development and test environment and configured all production deployments to push via git.

**CARMA for Picture Perfect**

Designed, developed and supported a data warehouse and web-based reporting program for the GE Picture Perfect access control system.  The database was designed to process tens of millions of transactions via a web based UI.  This tool gave users an easy-to-use, non-technical interface allowing them to run reports on-demand while not affecting the production system.  This not only reduced the load on the server, it removed the report generating responsibility from the system administrators and allowed stakeholders to run their own reports.  The UI was written in PHP running on Apache's HTTPD server, the data import was written in C++ and the database platform was MySQL.

**State of Florida DHSMV FUPAC Project**

The DHSMV in FL had a disparate access control system at each of its 12 deep water seaports.  We were responsible for visiting each port, exporting all cardholder and image information from each system, and turning them over to GE for conversion to their new system.
